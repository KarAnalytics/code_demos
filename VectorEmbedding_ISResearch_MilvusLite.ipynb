There are also complex concepts to optimize the index for vector search performance. For now, let's just focus on the basics and use default for everything possible. At minimum, you only need to set the collection name and the dimension of the vector field of the collection."

However, sustainability awareness only sometimes translates to actual green practices. In this study, we develop and test a model that explains how eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving can be promoted with post-trip visualized narratives. Drawing on human-computer interaction research, we integrate the mental construal literature to reveal feasibility and desirability perceptions as underlying mechanisms. We test our hypotheses in two experiments involving eye-tracking and driving simulation. Results show that pairwise animated illustration and prospective narratives elevated eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving. In the meantime, static illustration and retrospective narratives influenced attitudes toward efficient driving. In addition, feasibility and desirability perceptions were significant mediators. Overall, this study contributes to information systems literature, human-computer interaction literature, and the construal level theory by unraveling the effects of post-trip visualized narratives on promoting ecological practices and attitudes.\",\n          \"This study examines how the strength of social ties between focal and peer fundraisers interacts with the network structure generated by these social ties to determine crowdfunding performance. With relationship intensity and preference similarity between focal and peer fundraisers as the two dimensions of tie strength, our study discloses how the benefits and costs associated with these tie strength dimensions are affected by network closure, the degree to which peer fundraisers are connected to each other. Our estimation results indicate that (1) relationship intensity and preference similarity exhibit inverted U-shaped relationships with crowdfunding performance, and (2) network closure attenuates the effectiveness of tie strength dimensions. Together, our study findings reveal an important interplay between indirect and direct social ties. In essence, social ties among peer fundraisers facilitate a group identity that reduces the returns of time and resources a fundraiser spends on strengthening ties with these peer fundraisers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 227,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0332\",\n          \"https://www.jmis-web.org/articles/1653\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"JournalFN\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MIS Quarterly\",\n          \"Journal of the Association for Information Systems\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, sustainability awareness only sometimes translates to actual green practices. In this study, we develop and test a model that explains how eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving can be promoted with post-trip visualized narratives. Drawing on human-computer interaction research, we integrate the mental construal literature to reveal feasibility and desirability perceptions as underlying mechanisms. We test our hypotheses in two experiments involving eye-tracking and driving simulation. Results show that pairwise animated illustration and prospective narratives elevated eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving. In the meantime, static illustration and retrospective narratives influenced attitudes toward efficient driving. In addition, feasibility and desirability perceptions were significant mediators. Overall, this study contributes to information systems literature, human-computer interaction literature, and the construal level theory by unraveling the effects of post-trip visualized narratives on promoting ecological practices and attitudes.\",\n          \"This study examines how the strength of social ties between focal and peer fundraisers interacts with the network structure generated by these social ties to determine crowdfunding performance. With relationship intensity and preference similarity between focal and peer fundraisers as the two dimensions of tie strength, our study discloses how the benefits and costs associated with these tie strength dimensions are affected by network closure, the degree to which peer fundraisers are connected to each other. Our estimation results indicate that (1) relationship intensity and preference similarity exhibit inverted U-shaped relationships with crowdfunding performance, and (2) network closure attenuates the effectiveness of tie strength dimensions. Together, our study findings reveal an important interplay between indirect and direct social ties. In essence, social ties among peer fundraisers facilitate a group identity that reduces the returns of time and resources a fundraiser spends on strengthening ties with these peer fundraisers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 227,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0332\",\n          \"https://www.jmis-web.org/articles/1653\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"JournalFN\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MIS Quarterly\",\n          \"Journal of the Association for Information Systems\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

However, sustainability awareness only sometimes translates to actual green practices. In this study, we develop and test a model that explains how eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving can be promoted with post-trip visualized narratives. Drawing on human-computer interaction research, we integrate the mental construal literature to reveal feasibility and desirability perceptions as underlying mechanisms. We test our hypotheses in two experiments involving eye-tracking and driving simulation. Results show that pairwise animated illustration and prospective narratives elevated eco-driving behaviors and attitudes toward efficient driving. In the meantime, static illustration and retrospective narratives influenced attitudes toward efficient driving. In addition, feasibility and desirability perceptions were significant mediators. Overall, this study contributes to information systems literature, human-computer interaction literature, and the construal level theory by unraveling the effects of post-trip visualized narratives on promoting ecological practices and attitudes.\",\n          \"This study examines how the strength of social ties between focal and peer fundraisers interacts with the network structure generated by these social ties to determine crowdfunding performance. With relationship intensity and preference similarity between focal and peer fundraisers as the two dimensions of tie strength, our study discloses how the benefits and costs associated with these tie strength dimensions are affected by network closure, the degree to which peer fundraisers are connected to each other. Our estimation results indicate that (1) relationship intensity and preference similarity exhibit inverted U-shaped relationships with crowdfunding performance, and (2) network closure attenuates the effectiveness of tie strength dimensions. Together, our study findings reveal an important interplay between indirect and direct social ties. In essence, social ties among peer fundraisers facilitate a group identity that reduces the returns of time and resources a fundraiser spends on strengthening ties with these peer fundraisers.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 227,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2022.0332\",\n          \"https://www.jmis-web.org/articles/1653\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"JournalFN\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"MIS Quarterly\",\n          \"Journal of the Association for Information Systems\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"vector\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
